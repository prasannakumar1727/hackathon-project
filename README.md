# ❤️ Predictive Heart Attack Early Warning & Automated Emergency Response System

> Building intelligent healthcare technology that can save lives through early cardiac risk detection.

---

## 📌 Overview

Heart attacks remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide, often occurring without sufficient warning. Many patients fail to recognize early symptoms, resulting in delayed medical intervention.

This project focuses on developing a **real-time predictive healthcare system** that continuously monitors vital parameters and detects potential cardiac risk before a critical event occurs.

By integrating **Artificial Intelligence, IoT, and Biomedical Sensors**, the system not only predicts abnormalities but also triggers an automated emergency response — reducing reaction time and potentially saving lives.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Traditional health monitoring systems are reactive rather than preventive. Patients typically receive medical attention only after symptoms become severe.

Key challenges include:

- Lack of continuous monitoring  
- Delayed emergency response  
- Unnoticed early warning signs  
- Limited access to smart healthcare solutions  

There is a strong need for an **intelligent, proactive, and scalable system** capable of identifying cardiac threats early.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design a smart wearable-driven system that:

✅ Continuously monitors heart rate and vital signals  
✅ Uses AI to analyze patterns and detect anomalies  
✅ Predicts potential heart attack risk  
✅ Automatically alerts caregivers and emergency contacts  
✅ Enables faster medical response

## ⚙️ System Architecture

**Sensors → Microcontroller → Cloud / ML Model → Risk Analysis → Emergency Alert**

### Workflow:

1. Biomedical sensors collect real-time physiological data  
2. Microcontroller processes and transmits the data  
3. Machine Learning model evaluates risk patterns  
4. If abnormal activity is detected:
   - Emergency alerts are triggered  
   - Caregivers are notified  
   - Location data can be shared
